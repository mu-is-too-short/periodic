# periodic
PostScript periodic table as a program not just a drawing. I once
needed a printable peridoc table but I couldn't find one. At the
time, "printable" mean "PostScript" so I grabbed a copy of The Red
Book, learned the language, got used to stack-based thinking again,
and wrote a PostScript program.
